    I created this game using javascript and jquery. It was styled with bootstrap, css and some animations.

    - The game has for crystals displayed on the page and a randomly generated number.
    
    - When the player clicks on a crystal, a specific amount of points are added to the player's total score.
    
    - The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
    
    - The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

    - The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

    - When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
    
    -The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
